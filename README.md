# ObjectBlueprint


This is a personal project.

The aim of the project is to take a class and create a representation of an object of that class.
The representation that I have focused on in the beginning is JSON.

The project can also be used in testing (unit testing for example). Creating objects having only a class reference. This would skip the effort of initialization of every class in a test. Should be used with random values.

Future work:
Try to have a XML representation.
Implement unit tests using this project idea.
